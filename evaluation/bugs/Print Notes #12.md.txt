**Describe the bug**  
The app fails to initialize properly when launched for the second time after installation, displaying a white screen instead. This issue occurs due to the missing storage permission and the lack of a permission request dialog.

**Device Information**:  
- Device: generic_x86_64 (Android Studio x86 emulator)  
- OS: Android 9 

**To Reproduce**  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install or reset the app.
2. Launch the app and complete guidance as normal.
3. Exit the app.
4. Re-enter the app, and the white screen will appear (indicating initialization failure).

**Expected behavior**  
The app should prompt for storage permission if not already granted and show the necessary permission dialog, instead of failing to initialize and displaying a white screen.
