**Bug Description**  
After deleting the last TO-DO list, the Settings entry is mistakenly recognized as a TO-DO list. The TO-DO list action menu appears for the Settings entry, and performing any operation on it results in an error log.  

**To Reproduce**  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1. Create only one TO-DO list.
2. Delete the last remaining TO-DO list.  
3. Open the navigation menu and observe that the Settings entry is incorrectly treated as a TO-DO list.  
4. Attempt any action related to TO-DO lists.  
5. Check the error logcat.  

**Expected Behavior**  
The Settings entry should not be recognized as a TO-DO list, and no TO-DO list actions should be available for it.
