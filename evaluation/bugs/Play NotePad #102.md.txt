**Bug Description**
The app crashes when trying to add a voice recording to a note. This happens due to an unhandled `ActivityNotFoundException` when attempting to launch the speech recognition activity.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Tap on "Create New Note" button.
2. Add a voice recording for the new note.
3. The app crashes immediately.

**Expected Behavior**
The app should either:
- Successfully launch a voice recording interface, or
- Gracefully handle the absence of a speech recognition activity (e.g., show an error message or disable the feature if unsupported).

**Smartphone:**

- Device: generic_x86_64 (Android Studio x86 emulator)
- OS: Android 9.0 (Default Android System Image)
- Version: 1.3.7

**Suggested Fix**
Check if there's an app available to handle the `android.speech.action.RECOGNIZE_SPEECH` intent before launching it. If not, inform the user or disable the feature to avoid a crash.
